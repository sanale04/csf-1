<h3>
Problem 3: Recognizing Types
</h3>
Being able to recognize different types of objects in a program
can help you understand the program better. Use the type function to identify these different objects, then create your own examples. <br/>
Use the command line. <br/>
<br/>
ex1 = (1,5)<br/>
print ex1<br/>
<br/>
ex2 = "Good morning!"<br/>
print ex2<br/>
<br/>
ex3 = ["pink", "yellow", "green", "red", "purple", "blue", "orange"]<br/>
print ex3<br/>
<br/>
ex4 = {"Bob": 20, "Lucy": 21, "Adam": 21, "Karen": 22}
print ex4<br/>
<br/>
ex5 = [{"January": 1, "December":12}, 
{"January 1st": "New Years", "December 25th": "Christmas"}]
print ex5<br/>

<h3>
Problem 4: Identifying Values With an Index<br/>
</h3><br/>
Indexing can be useful. You can use indexing to call certain values from objects. Use indexing in these next few examples to get a better understanding of how it's done.<br/>
Use the command line.<br/>
<br/>
Use indexing to call the first, third, and fifth animal.<br/>
zoo = ["antelope", "giraffe", "penguin", "gorilla", "bear"]<br/>
print zoo<br/>
<br/>
Use indexing to call the second, fourth and sixth letter of this string.<br/>
zoo2 = 'walrus'<br/>
<br/>
Use indexing to call the last three values<br/>
x = (2,4,5,7,9)<br/>
<br/>

<h3>
Problem 5: An Index Within an Index <br/>
</h3><br/>
Sometimes there are cases where you find dictionaries within
lists and you need to call values within the dictionaries.
Try calling values within each of the dictionaries, not the key. So, use indexing to call just the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
candy = [{"sour patch kids":22, "sour gummy worms": 10}, {"m&ms": 13,
"snickers": 1},{"laffy taffy": 5}]<br/>
print candy<br/>
<br/>
Also do: Create your own example and use this type of indexing to call values<br/>
<br/>

<h3>
Problem 6: Using a For Loop With a Dictionary<br/>
</h3><br/>
Complete this for loop that prints out just the keys in the dictionary.<br/>
(Remember, a key would be like "redbull", and its value being 3.) <br/>
Hint: the '?' indicates something is missing, replace the '?'<br/>
<br/>
drinks = {"redbull": 3, "water": 4, "fresca": 1, "pom tea": 1,
"rockstar": 2}<br/>
<br/>
for (?) in drinks:<br/>
    print ?<br/>
<br/>
Now that we've practiced indexing, come up with a for loop that prints just the values for the dictionary 'drinks'<br/>
<br/>
Also: come up with a for loop that will print both the key and its value<br/>
<br/>

<h3>
Problem 7: Understanding and Using Assert<br/>
</h3><br/>
Assert can be useful in recognizing errors.<br/>
Run this program.<br/>
What happens when you do? Why?<br/>
<br/>
assert 1 == 0<br/>
<br/>
Set an integer value to the variable x<br/>
Change 1 and 0 to both x<br/>
What happens and why?<br/>
<br/>
How can this be useful?<br/>
