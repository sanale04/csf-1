Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

sample 1 - GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

By commenting out linenum = 0, a name error appears saying linenum 
is not defined. This happens because the for loop tries to use
linenum = linenum + 1, but it's not defined so it fails.

seq is not defined, so you can't add anything to it.

if commented out gc_count = 0, the for loop it's used in would have an error,
since it's incremented on during the loop.

Problem 4:

GC-content = 0.43029262963
AT_content = 0.56970737037

Reflection:

Doing this assigment began teaching me to look at
code more closely. I wish I knew more about this
kind of language, so my advice to future students would
be to memorize what you learn so you know what you are
looking at when you do this type of homework.
