Homework 5


Collaboration:

I did not work with any students on this homework,
I did what I could on my own.

Reflection:

This assignment was a struggle. I had a few ideas of what could
be done for problem one, but never came up with the correct 
solution. I learned what time-boxing was. Sometimes you
are only given a certain amount of time for completion
and you don't always come out with a finished project.
