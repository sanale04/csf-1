### Problem 1
###

print "Problem 1 solution follows:"
# x^2-5.86 x+8.5408
a = 1
b = -5.86
c = 8.5408

x1=(-b+math.sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/2*a
x2=(-b-math.sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/2*a

print x1
print x2
 # Answers found using the hint

###
### Problem 2
###

print "Problem 2 solution follows:"

import hw1_test
print hw1_test.a
print hw1_test.b
print hw1_test.c
print hw1_test.d
print hw1_test.e
print hw1_test.f

# Here I from module hw1_test I imported all the values, then I print using the values. 
#from hw1_test import a,b,c,d,e,f

#print a,b,c,d,e,f


# Answers found using import and print commands


###
### Problem 3
###

print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

BE = ((hw1_test.a and hw1_test.b) or (not hw1_test.c) and not (hw1_test.d or hw1_test.e or hw1_test.f))
print BE
# BE stands for boolean expression

# Reflection: This assignment took about 45 mins. The readings, tutorials and lectures helped. 
# Once my few questions were answered, I was able to set off.
